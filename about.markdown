Software developer, currently writing mostly in Python. I like complex problems, but simple solutions. Never opposite*.

On a daily basis, I work with the following languages and technologies:
- Python, Django, Flask, Tornado,
- REST, GraphQL, JSONRPC,
- Postgresql, RDS, RabbitMQ, ZMQ, SQS, Kinesis, AWS,
- Docker, Ansible, Puppet, Spinnaker,

During my lifetime I was exposed to dozens of languages, tools or paradigms, including Perl, JavaScript, C, Java, Haskell, Elm, and many others.
My favorite programming language? Python. For simplicity, power, clear and easy syntax.
Big enthusiast of e-learning, web services like Coursera, Edx, and MIT open lectures.

*okay, simple problems aren't that bad - bad it is, when they appear to often. Then it's the first sign, that you've stopped learning and started doing some boring, waste-of-time-like things.
